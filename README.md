World Happiness Report Dashboard (2015–2023)

📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing global happiness trends from the World Happiness Report (2015–2023).

The dashboard enables users to explore comparative trends across countries and regions, track year-over-year changes, and evaluate strategic KPIs such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, and perceptions of corruption.

The goal is to provide data-driven insights into how social, economic, and political factors influence global well-being.

🔎 Dataset

Source: World Happiness Report – Kaggle

Timeframe: 2015–2023

🛠️ Methodology
Data Preparation

Unified datasets from 2015–2023 into a single consolidated table.

Resolved inconsistencies in variable names across years.

Handled missing values and removed duplicates.

KPI Selection & Enrichment

Selected five key KPIs representing socio-economic and well-being dimensions:

Happiness Score – Overall measure of well-being.

GDP per Capita – Economic performance.

Healthy Life Expectancy – Public health indicator.

Social Support – Community and family networks.

Perceptions of Corruption – Governance and trust.

Derived new metrics for year-over-year percentage changes to track growth or decline.

🚀 Key Takeaways

Global happiness trends show regional disparities, with Northern Europe consistently ranking higher.

GDP per capita and life expectancy strongly correlate with happiness, though not universally.

Perceptions of corruption and social support significantly influence well-being, often more than economic factors.

Interactive exploration allows stakeholders to identify priority areas for policy and investment.
